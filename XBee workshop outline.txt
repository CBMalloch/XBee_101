XBee seminar

Notes from presentation 1 2011-06-23:
	need to label the radios (MY)
	new pictures, with suggested breadboard locations
		pot all the way to right, powered from rails
	templates for wiring *without* the Adafruit adapters plugged in
	suggested wiring colors
	need 3 hours
	skip plain Arduino hello world
	preprogram arduinos with hello world pot application
	everybody use a different PAN ID
		note about interference when programming
	put all settings on one page
	put wiring connections, pin-assignment picture, and wired picture on one page?
		maybe wire for left edge plus wiring without adapter inserted
		(yellow vertical wire where left edge of adapter goes, but wire not used otherwise)
	notes about installation of TTL232 wire, XBee chip -- note orientations!
	put the Arduino program(s) up on web site

Logistics
	v Date
	v Room
	v Bio to Baird
	v Outline to Josh
	v Soldering the XBee USB adapters

Intro
	Example applications
		serial communications
		TAW - http://makezine.com/18/tweetawatt/
	Zigbee / XBee
	
Activity 1: build a Hello World
	plug Arduino into proto board, power with USB
	start up Arduino code
	program: Hello World
		save, send, run, and monitor
Activity 2: build a Hello World Pot
	plug pot into Arduino
	program: modify code to read pot and send to PC
		save, send, run, and monitor
Activity 3: build a Hello World Pot Radio
	plug XBee into proto board and wire to Arduino
	plug another XBee into USB cable
	one team plug power supply into Arduino
	note everybody can read
	add teams plugging power into Arduino
	note what happens regarding interference
	
XBee settings 101:
	X-CTU
	PAN, MY, destinations high and low, serial number, text ID, baud
XBee settings 201:
	collision avoidance
	Hayes protocol

Activity 4: listen to Pot Radio
	everybody plug in their Arduinos
	should work just fine

IO Line Passing
IO - digital
	sampling
	sleep
		remarks about low-power operations
		wake-on-pin
		timer

Activity 5: digital line passing
	Using a switch on one XBee to control an LED on another

IO - analog
	ADC
	PWM
	
Activity 6: analog line passing
	Using a pot on one XBee to vary an LED on another

Choosing hardware for your project
	XBee vs. Pro
	Series 2 and mesh networking
